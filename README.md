# GEHP-GBT-Model
This mannul is for the code implementation of paper "Generalized extended persistent homology (GEPH)-based machine learning model for metalloprotein-ligand binding affinity prediction"
# How to use
Just replace the file path with your own after uploading the metalloprotein complexes datasets and you can get the train features and test features by running the GEPH-GBT-Train and GBPH-GBT-Test. Then, Runnig the GEPH-GBT-Model.
